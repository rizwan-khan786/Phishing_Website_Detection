# Phishing_Website_Detection

I worked on a project focused on detecting phishing websites using machine learning algorithms. The project involved collecting and analyzing large datasets of website features and user behavior, applying various machine learning models to identify patterns and anomalies, and developing a predictive model to accurately detect phishing websites. Through this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in machine learning, data analysis, and predictive modeling, as well as my ability to apply these skills to solve real-world problems related to cybersecurity.
